### title:: Eager Loading
# the "N plus one" problem is an ORM issue which refers to the many SELECT
# statements emitted when loading collections against a parent result.
# As SQLAlchemy is a full featured ORM, we of course include this! :)

#%% ## slide:: p
# However, SQLAlchemy was designed from the start to tame the "N plus one"
# problem by implementing **eager loading**.  Eager loading is now very mature,
# and the most effective strategy for collections is currently the
# **selectinload** option.

from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload

    ).scalars():
        print(user, user.addresses)

#%% ## slide:: p
# The oldest eager loading strategy is joinedload().  This uses a LEFT OUTER
# JOIN or INNER JOIN to load parent + child in one query.  joinedload() can
# work for collections as well, however it is best tailored towards many-to-one
# relationships, particularly those where the foreign key is "not null".

from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

#%% ## slide:: p
### title:: Instant Zen of Eager Loading
# eager loading *does not* change the *result* of the Query.
# only how related collections are loaded.   An explicit join()
# can be mixed with the joinedload() and they are kept separate
