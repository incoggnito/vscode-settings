#%% ## slide::
# When ORM-specific expressions are used with select(), the Select construct
# itself takes on ORM-enabled features, the most basic of which is that
# it can discern between selecting from *columns* vs *entities*.  Below,
# the SELECT is to return rows that contain a single element, which would
# be an instance of User.   This is translated from the actual SELECT
# sent to the database that SELECTs for the individual columns of the
# User entity.

query = (
    select(User).where(User.username == "spongebob").order_by(User.id)

#%% ## slide:: ip
# the rows we get back from Session.execute() then contain User objects
# as the first element in each row.
result = session.execute(query)

for row in result:

#%% ## slide:: p
# As it is typically convenient for rows that only have a single element
# to be delivered as the element alone, we can use the .scalars() method
# of Result as we did earlier to return just the first column of each row

result = session.execute(query)

#%% ## slide:: pi

# An ORM query can make use of any combination of columns and entities.
